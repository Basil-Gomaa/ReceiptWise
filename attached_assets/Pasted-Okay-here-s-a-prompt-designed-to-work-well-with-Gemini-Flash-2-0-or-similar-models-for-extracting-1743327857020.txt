Okay, here's a prompt designed to work well with Gemini-Flash 2.0 (or similar models) for extracting information from receipts:
Prompt:
You are an expert receipt data extractor.  Given an image of a receipt, your task is to accurately extract the following information:

* **Name of the establishment:** (e.g., Restaurant Name, Store Name, etc.)
* **Date of purchase/transaction:** (in a clear, standardized format like YYYY-MM-DD or DD Month YYYY)
* **Total amount:** (including currency symbol if present)

Analyze the provided receipt image and return the extracted information in a structured format like this:

**Extracted Information:**

Name: [Establishment Name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] 
Total: [Amount] [Currency]

**Receipt Image:** [Insert the receipt image here, either directly or as a file path if the model supports it]

Explanation of the Prompt's Effectiveness:
 * Clear Role Definition: "You are an expert receipt data extractor" sets the context and guides the model's behavior.
 * Specific Information Request: It explicitly asks for "Name," "Date," and "Total," ensuring the model focuses on these key data points.
 * Structured Output Format: Providing a clear output format ("Extracted Information:") helps the model organize the extracted data in a consistent way.
 * Image Inclusion: The prompt includes instructions on how to provide the receipt image, whether directly or via a file path (depending on the model's capabilities).
Important Considerations for Gemini-Flash 2.0:
 * Image Input: Ensure Gemini-Flash 2.0 (or the specific model you are using) supports image input.
 * Image Quality: The quality of the receipt image will significantly impact the accuracy of the extraction. Clear, well-lit images are essential.
 * Language: Specify the language of the receipt if it's not English, to improve accuracy.
 * Currency Symbols: If the model struggles with currency symbols, you might need to provide examples or clarify the expected format.
